# Leaderboard API Service

## Overview
The Leaderboard API service is responsible for managing user scores on a website, displaying the top 10 users on the leaderboard, and allowing real-time score updates when users complete an action that increases their score. The system will ensure security and prevent malicious behavior by ensuring that only authorized actions can increase user scores.

## Features
- **Real-Time Updates**: The leaderboard will be updated in real-time whenever a user's score changes.
- **Score Updates**: When a user completes an action, their score will be increased through an API request.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: The system ensures that only authorized actions can increase a user's score, preventing fraudulent behavior.
- **Top 10 Users**: The top 10 users with the highest scores will be displayed on the leaderboard, and this list will update dynamically.

## Functional Requirements
1. **Score Update**:
   - Users can increase their score by sending a POST request to `/api/update-score`.
   - The request must include the user’s ID and the score increment.
   - Only authorized users should be able to perform this action.

2. **Real-Time Leaderboard**:
   - Retrieve the top 10 users and their scores to display on the leaderboard.
   - When a score is updated, the new score will be broadcast to all clients viewing the leaderboard.

3. **Security**:
   - Authentication and authorization are required to ensure that only authorized users can update their own scores.
   - A token or session-based authentication mechanism should be used to ensure the user is logged in.
   - Rate limiting should be applied to prevent abuse of the API (e.g., submitting too many score update requests).

## APIs

1. POST /api/update-score

**Description**: This API is used to update a user's score.

#### Request
- Method: `POST`
- Endpoint: `/api/update-score`
- Headers:
  - `Authorization: Bearer <user_token>` — The token of the authenticated user.
- Request Body (JSON):
  ```json
  {
    "user_id": "<user_id>",
    "score_increment": <positive_integer>
  }
Response
Status: 200 OK
json
{
  "message": "Score successfully updated"
}

Error: 400 Bad Request (if the data is invalid)
json
{
  "error": "Invalid request data"
}

Error: 401 Unauthorized (if the user is not authorized)
json
{
  "error": "Unauthorized user"
}

2. GET /api/leaderboard
Description: This API retrieves the top 10 users and their scores to display on the leaderboard.

Request
Method: GET
Endpoint: /api/leaderboard
Headers:
Authorization: Bearer <user_token>
Response
Status: 200 OK
json

{
  "leaderboard": [
    {
      "user_id": "1",
      "username": "John Doe",
      "score": 1500
    },
    {
      "user_id": "2",
      "username": "Jane Doe",
      "score": 1400
    }
  ]
}

#Security Measures
Authentication: Use a token-based authentication system (JWT or OAuth) to verify that the user making the score update request is authorized to do so.
Authorization: Ensure that users can only update their own scores. This can be done by verifying the user ID and checking ownership of the score being updated.
Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the score update functionality.
Data Validation: Ensure that score_increment is a positive integer and that user_id exists in the database.
Real-Time Updates
The server will broadcast updates to clients via WebSocket (or another real-time technology such as Server-Sent Events or long polling). When a score is updated via the /api/update-score endpoint, the system will broadcast the new score information to all connected clients, ensuring the leaderboard is updated in real-time.

#WebSocket Endpoint (Optional)
Method: GET
Endpoint: /ws/leaderboard
Connection: Clients connect to this WebSocket endpoint to receive real-time updates about the leaderboard.
Message:
{"user_id": <user_id>, "new_score": <score_value>}: A message sent each time a user's score is updated.

#Data Model
The backend will store user information, including:
user_id: A unique identifier for the user.
username: The user’s username.
score: The user’s current score.
The leaderboard will be dynamically generated by querying the top 10 users with the highest scores from the database.

#Execution Flow
The user completes an action, triggering a score increase.
The client sends a POST request to /api/update-score with the user ID and score increment.
The backend verifies the user's identity using the provided token.
The backend updates the user’s score in the database.
The backend broadcasts real-time updates to all clients with the new score.
Clients display the updated leaderboard.

Additional Improvement Notes
Scalability:

Using caching mechanisms such as Redis can help speed up leaderboard queries and real-time score updates.
Consider implementing load balancing for WebSocket servers to handle large numbers of concurrent connections.
Error Handling:

Provide detailed error messages and log requests to help identify and troubleshoot issues.
Consider implementing an error tracking system to monitor failed score update requests.
API Versioning:

Consider adding API versioning (e.g., /api/v1/update-score) to support future updates without breaking existing clients.
Database Optimization:

Use optimized database structures (e.g., indexing the score field) to speed up queries for retrieving the top 10 users.

Testing:
Ensure comprehensive unit tests and integration tests are in place for all endpoints and authentication mechanisms.
